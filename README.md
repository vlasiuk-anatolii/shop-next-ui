# Shop Next UI

Shop Next UI is a web application for managing products, user authentication, and making purchases using Stripe. The app uses Next.js with Turbopack for fast development and performance, along with MUI for UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Demo

## Features

- **Authentication and Registration:** Users can sign up and log in to the system.
- **Adding Products:** After logging in, users can add products to the list.
- **Stripe Payment Integration:** You can make test purchases using the card:
  `4242 4242 4242 4242`.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Once a product is purchased, it disappears from the list in real time thanks to WebSockets.
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload product images in JPG format.

## Backend API

The frontend is connected to a backend built with **NestJS** and **Prisma**, deployed via **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**. It uses **PostgreSQL** as the database through **Amazon RDS** and features full CI/CD with **AWS CodePipeline** and **CodeBuild**.
